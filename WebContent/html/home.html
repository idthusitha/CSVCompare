                  I have a csv file which is containing same column names. E.g. Name, City, Country etc.. I have another csv file which is containing same column names but different no. of records with different values for columns. I have to check 1st file with the 2nd csv file by mentioning the differences with the column name with a highlighted area in the down grid. (This needed to be run/open in the web browser as a .html file)
